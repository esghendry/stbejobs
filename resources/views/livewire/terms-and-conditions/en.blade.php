                <p>The temporary worker acknowledges that providing inaccurate or incomplete information on this
                    enrollment form may affect their enrollment process, job offers from the temporary employment agency
                    and the underlying temporary employment contract. Any adverse consequences resulting from
                    inaccuracies or omissions in the registration form, either to the temporary worker or to the
                    temporary employment agency, shall be the sole responsibility of the temporary worker.</p> <br>
                <p>The information provided above will be treated confidentially by the temporary employment agency and
                    stored in the agency's computerized database. The temporary employment agency acts in accordance
                    with the Belgian Data Protection Act (GDPR). The temporary worker agrees that his/her identity data
                    will be provided to the client via the <strong>Staffing | ESG</strong> portal for the purpose of
                    obtaining
                    employment.</p> <br>
                <p>The temporary worker expressly agrees to the storage and sharing of his data with potential clients.
                    The registration form, including any attached curriculum vitae, will be stored for a period of 4
                    weeks, with the possibility of a 4-week extension. The temporary worker expressly agrees to such
                    extensions.</p> <br>
                <p>If the temporary worker starts activities within this period, his data will be kept for 7 years after
                    the termination of the last temporary employment contract.</p> <br>
                <p><strong>Staffing | ESG</strong> uses digital signatures, using only the email address provided by the
                    temporary worker.</p> <br>
                <p>Authorization forms and agreements are also sent for digital signature. The temporary worker is
                    required to digitally sign the document. Agreements that have not been signed by the temporary
                    worker within 14 days, but for which he has commenced work, are deemed to have been accepted by the
                    temporary worker. The same applies to authorizations.</p> <br>
                <p>All forms and agreements are drawn up in both Dutch and the language of the temporary workers. These
                    documents are identical in content and have been translated by a sworn translator. If the temporary
                    worker signs in either language, the signature applies to both versions. The Dutch language version
                    of the form and agreement is legally binding as the agreement is governed by Belgian law.</p> <br>
                <p>By submitting this registration form, the temporary worker agrees to all the provisions stated
                    herein, in particular the storage, sharing and method of using digital signatures for his data.</p>
